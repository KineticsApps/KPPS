    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>The CSV file must follow the following configurations</p>
    <ol id="listInstructions">

        <li><b>This new CSV file upload process</b> uses a data map for mapping list fields to CSV file fields.  This ensures accuracy, but inconsistent naming may need to be addressed.  Currently ITL is supported but more lists will be added.</li>
        <li><b>CSV file </b>should be based on these standard <a href="https://kineticsys.sharepoint.com/sites/projects/construction/SPP/000000000/Lists/Test%20Document%20Libraries/main.aspx?viewid=ad6bc77c%2Dafc8%2D47d2%2D96e1%2D8df38e233902" target="_blank">List Fields</li>
        <li><a href="https://kineticsys.sharepoint.com/sites/IntranetPortal/adm/ETL/documents/IT.csv" target="_blank">Sample CSV File</a>&nbsp; use as a template. Best practice is to use same column names. </li>
        <li>
            These fields types are <b>not</b> updatable and invalid in the CSV file:
            <ul>
                <li>Calculated Fields</li>
                <li>Other fields included in lookup (other than primary lookup field)</li>
                <li>System Fields (Modified, Created, Modified By, Created By etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Date Fields</b> should follow the dd/mm/yyyy format (e.g. 5/1/2019)</li>
        <li><b>CSV Values</b> must match the target list field type.  For example, an alpha character in an integer field will throw an error. </li>
        <li><b>CSV Field Order</b> is important.  Empty fields should stil be included in CSV Fie</li>
        <li><b>Different Column Names:</b> &nbsp; There are e inconsistences in column names (e.g. Vessel, Vessel_or_Location, Due Date, DueDate).  Best practice is to change the list field to match CSV.  Changing the field name in CSV may also work but is less reliable
        <li><b>Extra columns</b> in the CSV file (not in the data map) will be ignored. </li>
        <li>To <b>Add a new column</b> Email a request to helpdesk@kinetics.net and include site URL, list name, new field name and type)</li>
        <li><b>Lookup Fields</b> source tables should not be empty.  For example, updating the field "Area-Task-Name(from C.C. List)" requires the value be in the Cost Code List".
        <li>As a best practice make sure there are no leading or trailing <b>spaces</b> on file column headers or data  </li>
    </ol>
